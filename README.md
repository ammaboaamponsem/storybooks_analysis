# Data Analysis of Storybooks

The primary purpose in this exercise was to demonstrate different operations and techniques of data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualizations on a data set. The “books.csv” data set was the focus of this exercise which contained on books and their information including their titles, genres, number of pages, publication dates and ratings. With this analysis, we can instigate valuable insights and informed decisions for all book publishers and readers.
